# tech-blog

The Tech Blog is a (mostly) working blog site. Users can create a new account, add blog posts with a title and text, view all of their own posts on their dashboard, and see all users' posts on the homepage. 

Currently, users cannot update or delete their own posts nor leave comments on other users' posts.
